          Gravity Wars is not my original idea. I played a 1992 MAC version of
          this game with my friend and thought it fun. From my brief
          correspondence with the creator (Rhys Hollow) of the version for
          Macintosh I learned the original game was written for Amiga (and not
          by him). Since all the versions I could find online that would work on
          PC were unsatisfying I decided to re-make the game myself. Not being a
          programmer (having only taken a college level course in Java) I went
          for the easiest route: library bookshelf. I found Visual C++ to be the
          easiest approach (as it created the windows file menu automatically)
          and began to code. About a month later, after agony, tears, and much
          help from mIRC and the online forums community I had a working version
          of the game.
